 Revision tool

A small project I made to text a revision schedule in the morning, with a subject I need to revisit after 3 days of revising that.

### Early stages
This project is still in it's early stages, so there will be lots of bugs, errors and room for optimisations. Getting the basic functions down
first and then will go back and review my code.

Currently working on a webscaper that can get homework data and append that to the text message.
